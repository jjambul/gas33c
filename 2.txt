Midas is an asset tokenization protocol bringing regulatory-compliant exposure to institutional-grade assets onchain, unlocking DeFi composability for real-world assets (RWA). Tokenizing securities in a compliant way is complex, requires building deep legal expertise and multiple iterations. Midas started this journey in 2022, releasing its first security tokens in 2024 under a best-in-class regulatory setup that makes Midas tokens as frictionless as possible, for everyone. Midas stands at the forefront of innovation: we're not just participating in the market; we're aiming to redefine it. Each of our tokens represents a bold step forward, merging the reliability of traditional financial instruments with the efficiency and accessibility of DeFi.

We are building the financing layer for the AI era. Training and deploying AI models requires trillions of dollars of investment in GPUs, data centers, and power, yet today’s financial system struggles to recognize and unlock the value of this infrastructure. USD.AI bridges that gap by transforming physical compute into on-chain collateral, enabling anyone to access a dollar-pegged stablecoin (USDai) or its yield-bearing counterpart (sUSDai). Our protocol creates negotiable warehouse receipts for GPUs, tokenizes them, and brings them into decentralized finance, making compute a liquid and financeable asset class for the first time. This structure solves a hard problem: AI infrastructure is capital intensive, fragmented, and...

Reclaiming Our Real-World CommunitiesSocial media was born with a promise: to connect us all. It erased distance, building global communities. But in connecting with the world, have we disconnected from our own street? We live in a paradox. We feel for a stranger's story online, yet we might not know our own neighbor's name. The digital world gives us a quick hit of satisfaction—a 'like' feels like action—while our physical communities starve for genuine connection. These platforms amplify our most divisive instincts: comparison, envy, and outrage, because it keeps us scrolling. It's an addiction, and we all feel it. At Tirion, we believe this isn't a personal failing; it's a design flaw in both our digital and urban worlds. We've built cities for...

## We're building payment infrastructure that makes global commerce actually work. The Problem: Cross-border payments are broken. Small businesses pay 3-7% fees, wait days for settlements, and deal with currency conversion headaches. Blockchain was supposed to fix this, but existing solutions are too expensive for everyday commerce. Our Solution: Omne creates a dual-layer blockchain separating fast commerce transactions from secure settlement. Think Stripe's UX + Bitcoin's global reach, but with sub-cent transaction costs. What Makes Us Different: - Microscopic fees: Sub-cent costs (vs $0.30+ traditional payments) - Instant settlement: 3-second confirmations + 9-minute security finalization - Global by design: Built for...

The $100 billion gaming industry is on the verge of revolution. For decades, gamers have suffered under the pretense of ownership: purchasing digital assets to which they hold but negligible rights. Now, with the advent of blockchain technology, comes the opportunity to empower gamers with true ownership. At Fuel, our mission is to lead this revolution and transform the space as social and mobile platforms did years ago. With a small but exceptional team of artists, designers and engineers we are building Gods Unchained (godsunchained.com): a AAA trading card game where players have complete control over their assets. As we approach launch, we need the help of other talented professionals to help bring our game to the world.

Center is building the NFT infrastructure for the internet. We make it easy for builders to build NFT-enabled apps. Today, building NFT apps is incredibly time consuming. Imagine if in order to put up a personal website, you first had to crawl the entire internet. That would make launching a website pretty hard, right? That's exactly the case with NFTs today. We eliminate all this complexity for builders. Instead of spending months of engineering time building NFT infrastructure, developers use Center's APIs to search, show, and interact with NFTs on 14 blockchains.

At AVENX Technologies, we develop proprietary systems that merge AI, automation, and financial architecture. Our flagship product, Valuresta, is a patent-pending fintech engine designed to analyze, enrich, and re-route payment data to create measurable value at every point of exchange. Unlike traditional payment processors, Valuresta operates as an adaptive intelligence layer — learning from each transaction to predict, optimize, and transform ordinary payments into strategic profit flows. By building a unified engine that connects finance, data, and behavior, we’re redefining what it means for payments to “create value.” Valuresta isn’t just a platform — it’s a framework for the intelligent economy.

CreditLiquidity is building the independent valuation layer for tokenized credit. The missing bridge between institutional capital and Web3. Today, $20B+ in tokenized credit is locked out of institutional allocation because auditors reject protocol-provided valuations. The blocker isn’t yields or regulation. It’s audit compliance. Institutions can’t deploy capital if they can’t prove asset value to regulators or fiduciaries. We’re solving that. CreditLiquidity delivers AI-powered, audit-grade credit valuations that meet global standards (Basel III, Solvency II, ERISA). Our decentralized oracle network combines specialized AI credit agents, professional validators, and Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus to produce real-time, verifiable fair value...
